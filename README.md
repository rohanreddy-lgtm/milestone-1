Project Title:"Most Questionable Pizza Toppings"
Project Overview:
This project is a user-driven platform where people can log in and create or explore lists of the weirdest pizza toppings theyâ€™ve encountered. Each user will have their personalized list of bizarre toppings, and they can contribute to a global leaderboard of the most "creative" (or horrifying) toppings.

Key Features:
User authentication with personalized lists.
Ability to add, update, and delete toppings in their list.
Global leaderboard showing the weirdest toppings contributed by all users.
Topping descriptions with optional images for added hilarity.
Mobile-responsive UI with fun, pizza-themed animations.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React with Vite, CSS (for animations), Bootstrap.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose for schema design).
Tools: GitHub for version control, Bruno/Postman for API testing, Firebase Authentication for user login (optional).
Hosting: Netlify for the frontend and Render for the backend.
Why This Project:
This project is a fun way to practice creating a full-stack web app while building something that can make people laugh. It involves learning core concepts like CRUD operations, API development, authentication, and database integration. The humor of odd pizza toppings makes the project exciting and engaging to develop while tackling all the technical learning objectives.
